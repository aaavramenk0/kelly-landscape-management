            <q id="small-size-quote">We had our first interaction with Andrew and it was an amazing experience from there. I may butcher the spelling, but the crew leader Saul was just incredible. They laid about 13 pallets of SOD for us and did an amazing job, but 1 thing really stood out that I had to share because it’s the little thing that make the difference sometimes. </q>

            <q id="small-size-quote">I woke up early to hear the guys working hard, I look out and there is the owner of the company on Saturday morning laying SOD with the rest of the crew. Again, how refreshing it is to see a leader that also leads from the back and isn’t above helping his crew. Thank you James Kelly for your inspiring leadership. We are a Kelly Landscaping client forever and passionate advocate for your company!</q>

            <q>Excellent service!!! I had an irrigation system installed, landscape lighting, and lots of planting done. Weather delayed start time, but as soon as the project started, it was done in 2 days. Despite all the digging, my lawn looked undisturbed. Kept me in the loop on what and when. Walked-through after to show me how things worked. Pricing was reasonable. I’m considering purchasing their maintenance service. KLM-you guys rock!!!</q>
